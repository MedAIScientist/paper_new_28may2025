      "abstract": "Abstract An Addiction Consult Service (ACS) utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to fill an important gap in substance use treatment for patients who are admitted to an acute care hospital. While each ACS team's composition mirrors the needs of the patient population, there is a lack of literature on the role of psychologists within ACS teams despite psychotherapeutic intervention being a key component of substance use treatment. The current article aims to clarify how psychologists with specialized training in the treatment of substance use can contribute to the overall goal of an ACS in an acute care hospital setting. Drawing from the competency benchmarks put forth by the American Psychological Association to guide doctoral-level psychology training, we draw connections between relevant competencies for independent psychological practice and the ACS landscape. The importance of psychologists' competencies in Interdisciplinary Systems, Scientific Knowledge and Methods, Evidence-Based Practice, Individual and Cultural Diversity, and Relationships are highlighted and demonstrated through hypothetical case scenarios. This article provides an introduction to the ways in which psychology can contribute to the interdisciplinary environment of ACS, both clinically and foundationally. With this work, we hope to encourage additional inquiry into the intersection of psychology and addiction consult work. Keywords: Acute care; Addiction psychology; Consult-liaison; Substance use.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Given the poor long-term effectiveness of opioids for persistent non-cancer pain, and their potential for harm, evidence-based interventions to address opioid overprescribing for persistent pain are needed. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a primary care practice pharmacist-led intervention (PROMPPT review) for patients prescribed opioids for persistent pain and the feasibility of evaluating PROMPPT in a definitive trial. Methods: A single-arm study, with mixed methods process evaluation, was conducted in four English primary care practices. Adults prescribed opioids for ≥ 6 months were invited to participate in the Management of Opioids and Persistent Pain (MOPP) study by completing baseline and 3-month follow-up questionnaires. Practices invited a representative sample of MOPP participants to schedule a PROMPPT review, eight of which were audio-recorded. Following the review, pharmacists completed intervention delivery templates, and participants were sent an Acceptability Questionnaire and invited to consent to an interview. Results: Between November 2020 and May 2021, 148 participants were recruited to the MOPP study. Of these, 123 (83%) completed 3-month follow-up. Of 88 MOPP participants invited for a PROMPPT review, 80 (91%) attended. The review was rated completely acceptable or acceptable in 90% (45/50) of acceptability questionnaires returned. Overall, participants interviewed (n = 15) perceived the review as a good idea and recommended it to others; they preferred face-to-face consultations. Prior to the review, they reported mixed feelings, including feeling 'pleased' to be invited and 'grateful' someone was taking an interest, alongside concerns about what would happen during the review, including opioids being stopped and changes being detrimental. Following the review, those with a clear plan for follow-up/access to the pharmacist felt reassured about making changes to their pain medicines, whilst those advised to arrange follow-up as needed were less satisfied and more likely to report confusion about the plan. Conclusions: PROMPPT reviews appeared acceptable to patients, review uptake was high, and the study demonstrated the feasibility of a large definitive trial to evaluate PROMPPT. The review invitation, patient information, and pharmacist training were refined based on the findings ahead of a large cluster randomised controlled trial. Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN87628403 , registered 31 July 2020. Keywords: Acceptability; Chronic pain; Mixed methods; Opioids; Process evaluation; Tapering.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Mobile gaming applications are increasingly marketed as cognitive training tools for older adults, yet their scientific validity and accessibility remain uncertain. This scoping review evaluates their effectiveness and inclusivity. Methods: A systematic search of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store identified 227 applications, with 14 meeting inclusion criteria. Apps were assessed for scientific validity, theoretical foundation, accessibility, cognitive targeting, user engagement, and monetization models. Results: While all 14 apps claimed cognitive benefits, only one cited empirical research. None included baseline cognitive assessments or progress tracking. Accessibility was limited-eight apps had visual accommodations, but none provided auditory support. Six apps were English-only, restricting linguistic inclusivity. Monetization varied, with eight requiring in-app purchases or subscriptions, posing financial barriers. Conclusions: This review highlights critical gaps in the current cognitive gaming application market for older adults. Despite their popularity, cognitive training apps for older adults lack scientific validation and accessibility, limiting their effectiveness as cognitive interventions. Developers should integrate evidence-based training, adaptive assessments, and inclusive accessibility features such as voice guidance and multilingual support. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to assess real-world efficacy, refine interventions targeting memory, executive function, and processing speed, and enhance inclusive design for diverse aging populations.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: The surge in scientific publications during the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for reliable secondary studies such as Systematic Reviews, synthesising evidence to guide clinical and public health decisions. This study aimed to analyse the current practices, preferences, and challenges faced by researchers conducting secondary studies and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these practices. Methods: An online survey was conducted among researchers actively involved in secondary research. Email addresses were collected from PubMed for publications related to COVID-19 secondary studies between 2020 and 2022. The survey comprised 24 questions, including single- and multiple-choice formats, covering general information, Systematic Review processes, and changes during the pandemic. Statistical analysis, including Pearson's Chi 2 test, was performed on key responses to identify significant correlations. Results: This study highlights that only 26.9% of respondents use keyword-generation tools. However, those using PubMed were more likely to utilise MeSH ( p = 0.01486, df = 1, Chi 2 = 5.932568). Systematic Review software adoption was prevalent, particularly for Rapid Reviews, with Covidence being commonly used ( p = 0.00843, df = 1, Chi 2 = 6.938953), especially during the screening stage ( p = 0.02400, df = 1, Chi 2 = 5.094851). Despite this, many researchers still reported that they did not use any software. A total of 94.9% of respondents reported adherence to PRISMA guidelines, and protocol registration was strongly associated with following these guidelines ( p = 0.00320, df = 2, Chi 2 = 11.48858). Researchers using Embase were significantly more likely to incorporate RCTs ( p = 0.00360, df = 1, Chi 2 = 8.476092), while Cochrane reviewers showed a lower reliance on non-randomised trials ( p = 0.02601, df = 1, Chi 2 = 4.955580). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 64.3% of respondents observed a significant increase in secondary studies. Conclusions: This study highlights key trends in secondary research, emphasising adherence to established guidelines and the growing reliance on software tools. However, gaps remain in protocol registration and keyword generation practices. Addressing these gaps through targeted training may improve the quality of future secondary studies, particularly during global health crises.

      "abstract": "Abstract Bilateral asymmetrical hip dislocations are rare, occurring in only 0.01-0.02% of all joint dislocations, typically following high-energy trauma. We present a 22-year-old male involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, sustaining a right posterior hip dislocation with an associated posterior wall acetabular fracture and a left obturator-type anterior dislocation. He underwent successful closed reduction within two hours post-injury, but due to persistent instability of the posterior acetabular wall fracture, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) via a Kocher-Langenbeck approach was performed. A structured rehabilitation protocol facilitated full functional recovery at six months, with no evidence of avascular necrosis (AVN) or post-traumatic osteoarthritis. A literature review of relevant studies highlights the importance of early reduction (<6 h) to reduce AVN risk, timely surgical stabilization for acetabular fractures, and individualized rehabilitation strategies. While our case supports established treatment guidelines, long-term outcomes and optimal rehabilitation protocols remain areas for further research. Expedited diagnosis, early intervention, and evidence-based management are essential in achieving favorable outcomes for these complex injuries.

Several lifestyle factors, such as physical activity (PA), are modifiable, and in this study, we examined the association between leisure-time PA habits and the risk of a first-ever stroke. Methods: This prospective study included residents in Västerbotten, Sweden, who participated in the Västerbotten Intervention Programme at 40, 50, and 60 years of age. Altogether, 31,855 individuals (50.5% women, mean age: 42.6 [6.9] y at baseline) participated between 1989 and 2016. Leisure-time PA was categorized as irregular (never/now and then) or regular (once a week/2 or 3 times a week/more than 3 times a week). Changes in PA were compared between examinations (10 y apart). Cases of stroke were validated according to World Health Organization MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease) criteria. The risk related to changes in leisure-time PA was estimated using a multivariable Cox regression model. Results: During an average follow-up of 9.8 years (4.4), 609 incident first-ever stroke cases occurred (1.9%). A multivariable model showed that, compared with individuals with irregular PA at both examinations, those reporting regular PA over time had a lower risk of stroke (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% CI, 0.61-0.99). Conclusion: Middle-aged adults who maintained regular PA during their leisure time over 10 years had a lower risk of a first-ever stroke. This association is probably partly mediated by lower body mass index and a reduced risk of hypertension and diabetes. Keywords: epidemiology; exercise; healthy lifestyle; incidence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective : It remains unclear whether dietary live microbe intake is associated with biological aging. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the associations between dietary live microbe intake and biological aging. Methods : Our study included 7719 participants aged 20 years and older from the 2007-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants were categorized into groups using two distinct methods. The first method grouped participants based on the live microbial level of the consumed foods, dividing them into three dietary live microbe intake groups: low, medium, and high. The second method classified participants according to the quantity of live microbe-containing foods they consumed (referred to as MedHi), with three groups: G1 (no MedHi intake), G2 (MedHi intake below the median), and G3 (MedHi intake above the median). Biological age was evaluated using the Klemera-Doubal method biological age (KDM-BA) and phenotypic age (PA). KDM-BA acceleration and PA acceleration was determined if participants' KDM-BA or PA exceeded their chronological age, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to explore the associations of dietary live microbe intake groups and dietary MedHi intake groups with the acceleration of KDM-BA and PA. Results : Compared with participants in the low dietary live microbe intake group, those in the high dietary live microbe intake group had a 20% (95% CI: 2% to 35%) reduced risk of KDM-BA acceleration and a 25% (95% CI: 4% to 42%) reduced risk of PA acceleration. Similarly, participants in the G3 group with higher dietary MedHi intake had a 24% (95% CI: 10% to 35%) lower risk of KDM-BA acceleration and a 29% (95% CI: 17% to 39%) lower risk of PA acceleration compared with those in the G1 group. The stratified analyses showed that the associations of dietary MedHi intake with accelerated KDM-BA and PA were not influenced by age, gender, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, race, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion : Higher dietary intake of live microbes was inversely associated with accelerated biological aging. A diet rich in live microbes may help slow down the aging process.",

Methods: The ATTICA is a population-based cohort study with a 20-year follow-up conducted in the Attica region, Greece and included, 3042 adult males and females (45 [11] y). Participants physical activity levels' tracking together with data regarding cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes incidence, were available in 1988 participants (45 [12] y old, 987 males and 1001 females), at 20-year follow-up. Physical activity levels were evaluated using the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire, in all examinations (2001-2002, 2006, 2012, and 2022). Four physical activity trajectories were defined, that is, consistently active/inactive and changed from active/inactive. Path analysis was applied using structure equation models. Results: 54% of participants were classified as always inactive, 5% classified as became inactive from physically active, 38% as became active and, only 3% sustained physical activity levels. Participants who reported being consistently physically active throughout the 20-year period were 6% (OR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.89-0.99) less likely to develop cardiovascular disease as compared with those who remained consistently physically inactive, had 21% lower risk of developing hypercholesterolemia (OR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.59-1.04), 33% lower risk of obesity (OR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.44-1.02), and 30% lower risk of diabetes (OR, 0.70, 95% CI, 0.48-1.03).

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: The study aimed to investigate whether the associations of accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) vary based on different levels of hand grip strength, identifying the modifying role of grip strength in these associations. Methods: The study included 87 487 adults from the UK Biobank. PA and SB were quantified using accelerometers over 7-day period, while grip strength was assessed using a hand dynamometer. CKD events were ascertained through hospital records or death registries. Results: Participants had a mean age of 62.3 years, with 57.2% (50 062) identifying as female and 97% as White. Over a median follow-up of 7.0 years, the total incidence rate of CKD was 4.7 per 1000 person-years. Participants who performed higher volumes of PA were more likely to be younger; have better control of body weight, blood glucose and blood pressure; and have fewer major comorbidities (p < 0.001). Total PA, moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA), and light intensity PA (LPA), were inversely associated with CKD risk in a dose-response manner (all p overall < 0.050). In contrast, SB was associated with a higher risk of CKD (p overall < 0.001). Hand grip strength significantly modified the relationship between PA, SB, and CKD risk (p interaction < 0.10). The associations of total PA (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.84), MVPA (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.88), LPA (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.94), and SB (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.21-1.69) with CKD risk were more remarkable among individuals with lower hand grip strength. Of note, physical inactivity ranked higher in relative strength for predicting CKD than hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Conclusions: Hand grip strength could significantly modify the associations of accelerometer-measured PA and SB with the risk of CKD. Regardless of intensity, PA consistently correlates with reduced risk of CKD, while SB is associated with increased risk, especially among individuals with lower grip strength. Notably, physical inactivity was found to be as predictive of CKD as traditional risk factors, highlighting the importance of promoting PA, especially among those with lower grip strength.

      "abstract": "Abstract The senescence process is connected to the characteristics of cellular aging. Understanding their causal network helps develop a framework for creating new treatments to slow down the senescence process. A growing body of research indicates that aging may adversely affect stem cells (SCs). SCs change their capability to differentiate into different cell types and decrease their potential for renewal as they age. Research has indicated that consistent physical exercise offers several health advantages, including a reduced risk of age-associated ailments like tumors, heart disease, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Exercise is a potent physiological stressor linked to higher red blood cell counts and an enhanced immune system, promoting disease resistance. Sports impact mesenchymal SCs (MSCs), hematopoietic SCs (HSCs), neuronal SCs (NuSCs), and muscular SCs (MuSCs), among other aged SCs types. These changes to the niche will probably affect the amount and capability of adult SCs after exercise. In this work, we looked into how different types of SCs age. The impact of physical activity on the aging process has been studied. Additionally, there has been discussion and study on the impact of different sports and physical activities on SCs as an anti-aging component.
